# Canary: Early Warning System for Process Quality

Canary is an ecosystem to enable early warning functionality in existing architectures. It is designed to me modular, scalable, and easy to integrate with existing software and organizational processes. This way, it can be leveraged to provide `Shift Left` capabilities within an organization, allowing for early detection of potential issues when they are still easy to fix. Like a canary in a coal mine, it's intent is to send out a warning signal when something is going wrong, so adequate measures can be taken to prevent (economic) disaster.
