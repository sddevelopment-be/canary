# Canary: Early Warning System for Process Quality

Organizations across industries face the growing challenge of detecting operational issues too late—often after they have already led to costly disruptions. This challenge is exacerbated by the inherent complexity of modern software ecosystems, where legacy systems coexist with newer technologies, and by the increasing pressure to deliver software faster and more economically.

Many organizations struggle to implement consistent, scalable monitoring solutions due to diverse and evolving technological landscapes. At the same time, stringent legislative and regulatory requirements—especially in sectors like finance and healthcare—demand robust compliance and risk mitigation measures.

The Canary Platform is conceived as a modular, scalable early warning system designed to integrate seamlessly with existing architectures. By shifting critical monitoring tasks _“left”_ in the operational process, Canary detects potential issues early—when they are simpler and more cost-effective to fix—thus safeguarding operational integrity, reducing economic risk, and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.

## Business Context

### Problem Statement

- **Late Detection of Issues:**  
  Many organizations struggle with operational issues that arise from detecting problems too late.
  - The cost of remediation increases exponentially as issues progress.

- **System Complexity:**  
  The inherent complexity of modern software systems makes it difficult for teams to gain a holistic understanding of their environments.
  - A blend of legacy and modern technologies complicates the implementation of consistent monitoring solutions.

- **Economic Pressures:**  
  The pressure to deliver software faster and at lower costs often results in quality compromises.
  - This leads to more defects in production and, subsequently, higher operational costs.
  - Development teams may forego robust monitoring solutions due to feature delivery pressures.

- **Regulatory and Compliance Demands:**  
  Increasingly stringent legislative requirements—particularly in finance and healthcare—require organizations to maintain deep insight into their systems.
  - Compliance is often achieved via manual, error-prone processes that are slow and hard to scale.

### Unique Value Proposition

- **Seamless Integration:**  
  Canary’s modular architecture is designed for ease-of-integration with existing systems, ensuring that:
  - A domain-specific language defines rules and actions.
  - A template-based approach generates code for multiple languages and platforms.

- **Early Issue Detection:**  
  By shifting monitoring tasks _“left”_ in the operational process, Canary:
  - Detects issues early, when they are easier and less costly to resolve.
  - Safeguards operational integrity, reduces economic risk, and ensures regulatory compliance.

- **Empowering Business Domains:**  
  Canary keeps the control of core business processes with the organization by:
  - Providing a flexible rule engine that executes client-defined rules.
  - Using a plug-in architecture to extend the rule engine without disrupting the core system.
  - Offering domain-agnostic communication libraries that integrate easily with existing systems.

### Key Components

#### Notable External Systems

These external systems are critical to the operation of the Canary Platform, providing essential data and functionalities. Detailed interactions with these systems are described in the Key Interactions and Process Flow sections.

- **Communication Provider:**  
  Manages the sending, receiving, and storage of messages to both people and systems.

- **BI Dashboards:**  
  Presents a visual representation of process execution data in an accessible format.

- **Value Delivering System:**  
  Executes operational processes in accordance with business logic, directly delivering value to the organization.

#### Canary Platform Components

The internal components of the Canary Platform are responsible for assessing process quality, distributing notifications, and enabling in-depth inspection of process executions. Their detailed descriptions can be found in the respective Domain Descriptions.

### Key Design Ideas

- **Modularity and Integration:**
  - Emphasize a modular, event-based interaction model to allow decoupled components and simple extensibility.
  - Utilize core libraries, ports-and-adapters architecture, and standard API definitions (e.g., using the OPEN API specification) to integrate easily with existing systems.

- **Automated Code Generation:**
  - Leverage a domain-specific language and template-based approaches to generate code for different languages and platforms.
  - Define GraphQL-based query interfaces for flexible data retrieval.

- **Customization Through Client-Defined Rules:**
  - Provide a robust rule engine that executes custom rules defined by the client.
  - Use a plug-in architecture to enable seamless extension of the rule engine.

- **Reuse of Existing Solutions:**
  - Integrate with current monitoring, alerting, logging, and tracing solutions to minimize onboarding effort and enhance transparency.

- **Container-Based Deployment:**
  - Employ containerization to simplify system scaling, management, and consistent deployment across environments.
