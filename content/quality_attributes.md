# Quality Attributes

Within systems engineering, quality attributes represent the non-functional requirements that evaluate a system’s overall performance. Often referred to as architecture characteristics or _"ilities"_, these attributes are architecturally significant and require careful consideration by architects during design and implementation. This section describes the quality attributes deemed most important for the Canary system, which will guide our architectural decisions.

## Interoperability

> The ability of a system to work with other systems without special effort on the part of the user.

### Rationale

Interoperability is vital for stakeholders such as the Value Stream System Developer, Operator, and Business Intelligence Officer. They require a platform that integrates seamlessly with both legacy and modern systems without necessitating significant changes. This quality attribute supports smooth data exchange and communication, ensuring non-intrusive integration that maintains business process continuity across diverse environments.

### Key Success Factors

* **Seamless Integration:** Ability to connect with existing systems and accommodate future integrations without altering core structures.
* **Broad Compatibility:** Support for various operating systems, deployment platforms, and programming languages.
* **Protocol and Pattern Support:** Native support for multiple communication protocols (e.g., JSON over HTTP, RPC, file-transfer) and communication patterns (synchronous, asynchronous, publish-subscribe).
* **Minimal Performance Impact:** Integration that does not adversely affect the performance of existing systems.

## Extensibility

> The ability of a system to be extended and enhanced without requiring major changes to the system's architecture.

### Rationale

Extensibility is crucial for both the Value Stream System Developer and the Platform Developer, who need the freedom to choose the best tools and methods to address business requirements. By enabling plug-ins, configuration-based enhancements, and customizations, the Canary platform can evolve alongside changing business processes, promoting rapid innovation without disrupting the core architecture.

### Key Success Factors

* **Configuration-Based Enhancements:** Allow users to add new functionality without modifying the underlying code.
* **Customization for Domain-Specific Needs:** Support tailored modifications that align with unique industry requirements and business processes.
* **Plug-In Architecture:** Enable additional features or components to be integrated without altering the core system, preserving stability and flexibility.

## Scalability

> The ability of a system to handle a growing amount of work or its potential to accommodate growth.

### Rationale

Scalability is a fundamental requirement for stakeholders such as the Operator, Business Intelligence Officer, and Compliance Officer. As organizations expand and data volumes increase, the Canary platform must continue to perform reliably. Whether through horizontal scaling (adding more instances) or improving internal capacity, scalability ensures that the system remains responsive and effective under increased load.

### Key Success Factors

* **Load Management:** Ability to manage increased data volume, user traffic, and transaction throughput.
* **Horizontal Scalability:** Support for adding more instances to distribute load.
* **Internal Scalability:** Enhanced capacity within a single instance to handle higher demands.
* **Multi-Tenancy:** Capability to serve multiple users or organizations on a single instance without compromising performance.

## Reliability

> The ability of a system to perform its required functions under stated conditions for a specified period of time.

### Rationale

Reliability is essential for maintaining continuous operations and is particularly important for Operators and Compliance Officers. With stringent availability targets and mechanisms for graceful degradation, the Canary platform must ensure consistent performance and data integrity, even under stress. This minimizes downtime and protects critical business operations.

### Key Success Factors

* **High Availability:** Target availability of 99.9% or greater.
* **Graceful Degradation:** Ability to maintain core functionality when parts of the system fail.
* **Data Integrity:** Ensuring that messages are not dropped and data corruption is avoided.
* **Consistent Performance:** Reliable operation under varied load conditions.

## Security

> The ability of a system to protect data and resources from unauthorized access and malicious attacks.

### Rationale

Security is a non-negotiable attribute that underpins stakeholder trust, particularly for Compliance Officers and Operators. The Canary platform must safeguard sensitive information and ensure that all interactions—both internal and external—are secure. This not only protects against potential threats but also supports regulatory compliance and risk management efforts.

### Key Success Factors

* **Access Controls:** Robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.
* **Data Protection:** Encryption and secure data storage practices to ensure confidentiality and integrity.
* **Threat Detection:** Real-time monitoring and alerting for potential security breaches.
* **Compliance Alignment:** Mechanisms that align with industry standards and regulatory requirements for data security.

## Maintainability

> The ability of a system to be easily maintained and updated.

### Rationale

Maintainability ensures that the Canary platform can evolve over time to meet new requirements and incorporate improvements without significant rework. This attribute is vital for developers and operational teams who must regularly update and troubleshoot the system. A maintainable system reduces technical debt, facilitates faster issue resolution, and supports long-term adaptability.

### Key Success Factors

* **Modular Architecture:** A design that isolates changes to specific components without affecting the entire system.
* **Clear Documentation:** Comprehensive and accessible documentation that aids developers and maintainers.
* **Automated Testing and Deployment:** Integrated CI/CD pipelines that facilitate rapid testing, deployment, and rollback.
* **Ease of Debugging:** Tools and practices that enable quick identification and resolution of issues.

## Adoptability

> The ease with which a system can be learned, adopted, and effectively utilized by all its intended users—ranging from technical staff to operational agents and internal end-users.

### Rationale

Adoptability is essential for ensuring that the Canary platform can be quickly and efficiently integrated into an organization’s existing workflows. When a system is easy to adopt, it reduces the learning curve and minimizes resistance among users, leading to faster realization of benefits and higher overall satisfaction. For Value Stream Managers, ensuring that technical staff, operators, and internal end-users are well-trained and confident with the platform is key to maximizing productivity and mitigating risks associated with misconfiguration or improper usage.

### Key Success Factors

* **Comprehensive Documentation and Training Materials:** Detailed user guides, technical manuals, interactive tutorials, and role-specific training resources to support different user groups.
* **Intuitive User Interfaces:** Interfaces designed for ease-of-use that minimize complexity, enabling users to quickly understand and navigate the system.
* **Structured Onboarding Processes:** Formal onboarding programs including webinars, hands-on workshops, and guided walkthroughs tailored for both technical and non-technical users.
* **Integrated Support Resources:** Accessible helpdesks, FAQs, and community forums that provide timely assistance and foster a collaborative learning environment.
* **Customizable User Experience:** Features that allow users to tailor dashboards and workflows to their specific needs, enhancing usability and personal efficiency.
* **Regular Communication and Feedback Loops:** Mechanisms for continuous user feedback and regular updates to documentation and training resources, ensuring that the system evolves in line with user needs.
