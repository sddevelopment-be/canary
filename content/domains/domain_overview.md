# Domain Descriptions

Domain descriptions provide detailed information about the key components of the Canary platform, including their responsibilities, interactions, and relationships. These domain descriptions are essential for understanding the internal workings of the Canary platform and how its components interact to provide early warning functionality. By exploring these domains, stakeholders can gain a deeper understanding of the platform's architecture, design principles, and key features.

Each of these domains is self-contained. Meaning they operate on their own accord within their designated boundaries of responsibility. They interact with other domains through well-defined interfaces and protocols. This ensures that each domain can be developed, tested, and maintained independently, allowing for greater flexibility and scalability in the overall system architecture.

The domain descriptions are structured to provide a comprehensive overview of the domain, its key components, and their interactions with other domains. This section includes domain descriptions for the following core domains:

* [Quality Assessment](./domains/quality_assessment.md)
* [Communication Domain](./domains/communication.md)
* [Inspection Domain](./domains/monitoring.md)
