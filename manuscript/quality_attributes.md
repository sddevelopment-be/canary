# Quality Attributes

Within systems engineering, quality attributes are realized non-functional requirements used to evaluate the performance of a system. TThese are sometimes named architecture characteristics, or _"ilities"_ after the suffix many of the words share. They are usually architecturally significant requirements that require architects' attention. This section will describe the quality attributes (QA) that were deemed most important for the system, and that will be used to guide the architectural decisions.

## Overview

| Quality Attribute | Description | 
|-------------------|-------------| 


## Interoperability

> The ability of a system to work with other systems without special effort on the part of the user.



## Extensibility

> The ability of a system to be extended and enhanced without requiring major changes to the system's architecture.

## Scalability

> The ability of a system to handle a growing amount of work or its potential to accommodate growth.

## Reliability

> The ability of a system to perform its required functions under stated conditions for a specified period of time.
