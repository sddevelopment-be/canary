# Quality Attributes

Within systems engineering, quality attributes are realized non-functional requirements used to evaluate the performance of a system. TThese are sometimes named architecture characteristics, or _"ilities"_ after the suffix many of the words share. They are usually architecturally significant requirements that require architects' attention. This section will describe the quality attributes (QA) that were deemed most important for the system, and that will be used to guide the architectural decisions.
