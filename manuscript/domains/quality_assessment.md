# Domain: Quality Assessment

The Quality Assessment domain is responsible for evaluating the quality of operational processes using predefined quality indicators and metrics. It defines and categorizes quality measures, continuously monitors process performance, and identifies areas for improvement to ensure that operations meet organizational standards and objectives. By tracking these quality indicators in near real-time, the Canary platform can detect deviations from expected behavior and provide early warnings to operators, enabling prompt corrective action.

## Overview

This domain leverages a rule-based engine to process incoming data streams, apply configurable rulesets, and assess process quality. Designed for flexibility and extensibility, it supports both generic quality checks and domain-specific customizations, all while handling high volumes of data efficiently.

## Main Challenges

- **Classification of Quality Indicators:**  
  Developing methods to define and categorize incoming data based on characteristic traits, so that appropriate quality assessment rulesets can be applied.

- **Data Volume:**  
  Efficiently processing, analyzing, and storing large amounts of data generated by operational processes, while preventing overload and minimizing duplicate data.

- **Near Real-Time Processing:**  
  Delivering low-latency insights through efficient data streaming and real-time analytics, ensuring that quality deviations are detected and communicated immediately.

- **Quality Metrics Definition:**  
  Supporting a wide range of quality indicators by enabling customizable metrics, thresholds, and alerts tailored to specific process criteria.

- **Scalability and Performance:**  
  Maintaining high performance as the platform scales and integrates with additional systems, requiring optimized resource allocation, load balancing, and streamlined processing pipelines.

## Approach and Methodology

The Quality Assessment domain employs a rule-based engine to evaluate process quality by applying customizable rules to incoming data. Key elements include:

- **Generic Rule Application:**  
  The engine processes data in a standardized, serialized format (e.g., structured text), enabling it to apply value-type based rules generically without requiring an understanding of the underlying semantics.

- **Granularity of Rules:**  
  Rules are defined at two levels:
  - **Data Item Level:** Rules that validate individual data elements (e.g., data type, range, or format checks).
  - **Data Set Level:** Rules that assess collections of data items (e.g., verifying the length, presence or absence of content, correlation checks, or pattern matching).

- **Customization and Extensibility:**  
  While the core ruleset covers basic quality checks, more complex, domain-specific rules can be implemented as plugins. These plugins interact through standard interfaces, ensuring seamless integration with the core ruleset libraries.

- **Cost-Effective Processing:**  
  To reduce the operational burden, particularly under high data volumes, heavy validation rules may be deployed on the client side. This minimizes data transfer overhead and lowers the processing load on the platformâ€™s central infrastructure while preserving flexibility for clients with the necessary resources.
